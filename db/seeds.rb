# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# User.create(name: 'Matt Dressman', email: 'matt@wearecivilized.us', password: 'foobar', admin: true)
# projects = Project.create([{name: 'Kingdom Hope'}, {name: 'IDEA Idea'}, {name: 'OAC'}, {name: 'Bianco'}])
# kh_milestones = Milestone.create([{name: 'Business Cards', deadline: 2.days.from_now, project_id: projects.first.id},{name: 'Website', deadline: -3.days.from_now, project_id: projects.first.id}])
